https://nulib.github.io/admin-react-components/styleguide/

### Using the component library and assets

Add the package to your React project:

```
npm install --save @nulib/admin-react-components
```

## Developing

To develop in the component repository:

1. Clone the project
2. Enter the `admin-react-components` directory: `cd admin-react-components`
3. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

Use Styleguidis for a development environment. Run:

```
npm run styleguide
```

which will spin up a local Styleguidist webpack dev server that handles live-reloading as you write tests, build out components, and write documentation.

## Running the tests

```
npm run test

// or
npm run test:watch
```

## Building the package

To build the package, we use Rollup:

```
npm run build
```

To directly build the latest version of the style guide:

```
npm run styleguide:build
```

## ADR

To document architecture decisions, we use the [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) package. To document a new architecture decision via `adr-tools` markdown template generator, run:

```
adr new your-text-here
```
